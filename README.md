My wedding planner website is a fully responsive platform that allows users to plan their weddings seamlessly. Visitors can explore the homepage to view services, browse venues, and access additional pages. After registering and signing in, users can book venues, send guest invitations via email, and select catering, photography, music, and makeup services.

Authentication & User Roles
User Authentication: Secure login and registration ensure that only registered users can access wedding planning features.
Admin Panel: Only admins can access advanced features like managing galleries, venues (with Google Maps integration), catering categories, and music bands. Regular users do not see these options in the navbar.
Venue Booking & Catering Selection
Users can search venues by city, price, and capacity and view multiple images before booking. If a venue is already booked for the selected date, a conflict message appears.
The catering section allows users to choose food by category (starters, main course, dessert, drinks, etc.), customize quantities, and add details before adding them to the shopping cart.
Cloudinary Integration
Cloudinary is used for image uploads across the platform, ensuring optimized storage, fast loading, and high-quality display for venue images, catering items, and gallery images.
Admins can upload and manage multiple images for venues and other wedding services via the Admin Panel.
Shopping Cart & Checkout
Users can review and manage selected services before checkout.
Stripe integration enables a secure and smooth payment process.
Mobile Responsiveness & User Dashboard
The site is fully responsive, with a mobile-friendly navbar for an optimized experience.
The dashboard includes a wedding countdown, to-do list, and a summary of selected services (venue details, catering, photography, etc.).
This structured approach ensures a smooth wedding planning experience, from venue booking to final checkout!
